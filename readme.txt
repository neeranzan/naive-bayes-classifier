The tar file contains script files and data file and Report.docx file. The answers to all required question is in Report.docx file.

*DEBUG MODE*

We have script function accuracyCalculation.m file.It accepts the value of beta as input arguments.The script prints accuracy after completion of execution.

To observe accuracy rate, Go to MATLAB command line and type-

->accuracyCalculation(beta_value);

where beta_value is the value for beta under the value of which you want to test accuracy.

-There is another script file highest_measure.m which simple prints the highest measure words.In your MATLAB, simple type

â€”> highest_measure


*IMPORTANT*

The accuracy calculation script file takes little time to run (4-5 min). I optimized the performance wherever possible.

The dataset files should be in the same folder of script files.


-Codes are commented fully so as to facilitate the user. Before each variable declaration is the comment for which the variable is used for.This will make clear flow of the program.
